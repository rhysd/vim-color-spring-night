`colors/spring-night.vim` is generated by script `gen/src/main.rs` written in Rust.
Running the script outputs a generated script to stdout.

You need to install Rust toolchain following [the official steps](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
and confirm that `cargo` command is available for package management for Rust. Rust 1.30 or later
is required.

To generate a colorscheme file:

```
$ cargo run -- --dir ..
```

Without `--dir` option, it dumps output to stdout. Please see `--help` for more detail.

To run tests:

```
$ cargo test
```

To build an executable:

```
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/gen-color-spring-night --dir ..
```

To modify colors or highlights, you can update tables and lists in `spring_night_writer()` function.

- `table`: Color table. Key is a color name and value is corresponding colors for both GUI and terminal.
- `highlights`: List of highlights. Each element contains highlight name, foreground/background colors
  and highlight attributes.
- `term_colors`: List of 16 colors for terminal by color names. They are used in terminal window opened
  by `:terminal` command.
- `airline_theme`: Color palette for [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline). `mode`
  field has the color palettes for each mode in Vim.
- `alacritty_theme`: Color palette for [alacritty](https://alacritty.org/).
